# FBLADressFinal
Mobile Applications for FBLA SLC
Go to https://github.com/Bhumik29/FBLADressFinal and click on the read me file in order to recieve the link to download the app and view it 
from the Google Play Store. It can only be downloaded through an Android Device.


Open Android Studio (Eclipse's official IDE) in order to view the code, it can only be viewed through Androd Studio. The code can be 
seen on Eclipse but, there will be some errors as Eclipse lacks some features of Android Studio. 
In Android Studio, click on import new project and from the flashdrive click on "click on me but do not import" and then click on 
"import this one" and begin importing the project. 

The project will open up in Android Studio and you will be able to view all the code. Hoewever, to effectively view the app make sure to 
download it from the link that is avaialbe in the read me file on https://github.com/Bhumik29/FBLADressFinal

Thank you and enjoy!
