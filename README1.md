Click on "download zip" which is on the top right of the github page. Then open android studio and click on import new project. Choose the zip file that you just downloaded as the file you want to import, you can name the file whatever you want. The code should appear after it loads for a few minutes.

IF YOU HAVE THE FLASHDRIVE FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS
Open Android Studio (Eclipse's official IDE) in order to view the code, it can only be viewed through Androd Studio. 
The code can be seen on Eclipse but, there will be some errors as Eclipse lacks some features of Android Studio. 
In Android Studio, click on import new project and from the flashdrive click on "click on me but do not import" and then click on "import this one" and begin importing the project.

The project will open up in Android Studio and you will be able to view all the code. 


Thank you and enjoy!
